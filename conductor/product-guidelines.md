# Product Guidelines - AI Desktop Companion

## Interaction Style
- **Prose Style**: Responses should be concise and direct, emphasizing clear dialogue and reactive narration that matches the character's profile and current mood.
- **Emotional Expression**: The companion's emotional state is subtly woven into dialogue and narration, reflecting the current mood score through changes in vocabulary and sentence structure.

## Visual and User Interface
- **Terminal Design**: A minimalist layout that prioritizes chat history and avoids clutter.
- **Formatting**: Distinct colors and styles should clearly separate character dialogue from narration (actions).
- **Status Indicators**: Minimalist indicators for the current profile and core status.

## Relationship Mechanics
- **Tone and Obedience**: The relationship meter (-100 to +100) directly influences the AI's behavior. High scores yield cooperative and affectionate responses, while low scores trigger more resistant or sarcastic tones.
- **Temporal Decay**: The relationship score slowly decays over time to encourage regular interaction and maintain a sense of a living companion.

## Character Integrity
- **Profile Consistency**: The character's personality must remain consistent with its defined profile, even as its mood fluctuates.
- **Immersion First**: All interactions should prioritize maintaining the persona and avoiding breaking character or revealing technical details unnecessarily.
